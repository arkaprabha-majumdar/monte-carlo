# monte-carlo
Monte Carlo allows us to simulate seemingly random events, and assess risks (among other results, of course). It has been used to assess the risk of a given trading strategy.
For this repository, we will simulate a player in a casino with the following odds <b>49-51</b>:
<ul>
  <li>player plays risk free and bets same amount each time</li>
  <li>player doubles bet each time he wins</li>
  <li>player doubles his bet each time, regardless of win/loss</li>
</ul>

Also, it is proved that doubling your bet each time is much better chance than doing an aggressive bet.
